# ðŸ™‹ Hello! My name is Divu!
I like to do a lot of computer science and computer science-adjacent projects and activities in my free time (among other things), but most of the time I do not really post them on GitHub. I used to publish most of my work on Replit, however now the free account limitations prevent me from adding anything new. As I finish new projects and publicize them, I'll start to do it here.
